# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for grouper hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).
#

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)

# Get the prebuilt list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)

# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)

# must be before including omni part
TARGET_BOOTANIMATION_SIZE := 2560x1440

# Inherit from our custom product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)

# Inherit from hardware-specific part of the product configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/huawei/angler/device.mk)

# Inherit Omni GSM telephony parts
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)

# Inherit some common Omni stuff
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)

# Enhanced NFC
$(call inherit-product, vendor/cm/config/nfc_enhanced.mk)

# Inherit device configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/huawei/angler/aosp_angler.mk)
